This block needs: 
tophat (or other mapper of choice)
R packages: ShortReads, GenomicAlignments, GenomicFeatures, Rsamtools


provided code assumes SLURM scheduler
one needs to change a root folder and put the data in an appropriate subfolder

overall flow is:
step1 - trim the data
step2 - map
step3 - get short fastqc
step4 - filter out by quality
step5 - get gene level counts
step6 - convert counts to TRECASE_MLE format 
#note, we only keep the genes which have at least two individuals having at least 5 allele specific counts
#these processing steps are done for each chromosome
