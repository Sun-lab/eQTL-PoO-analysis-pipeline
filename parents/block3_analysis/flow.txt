This block needs: 
1 R libraries 
- library(asSeq)
- library("GenomicAlignments")
- library("GenomicFeatures")
- library("Rsamtools")
2 C code TRECASE_MLE


overall flow is:


#these processing steps are done for each individual
step8 - classify reads having at least one SNP to coming from one parent or another 
(for this dataset we can't say which is mother and which is father)
and get a gene-level count
Note: check that number of _hapN is not large as a control as well as _hap1 and _hap2 are comparable

#this step is done on the results of all individuals processed before
step9 - few checks and conversion to TRECASE_MLE format

#this step is done for each chromosome
step10 - run TRECASE_MLE (we had several runs with various criterios including forcing a particular SNP to be used in order to estimate effect size)
step11 - collect the results from TRECASE_MLE
