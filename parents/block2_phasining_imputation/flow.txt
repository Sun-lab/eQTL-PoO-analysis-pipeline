This block needs: 
0 plink
1 liftover for remapping between references
2 shapeit2 for phasing
3 impute v.2 for imputation

used omni VCF data for GEUVADIS project
ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/phase1/analysis_results/supporting/omni_haplotypes/

overall flow is:


#these processing steps are done for each chromosome
step0 - format the data to shapeit compatible format
step1 - first run shapeit to get a list of non-matching SNPs (will be compared to step 2 and excluded in step 3)
step2 - second run of shapeit with a flipped list of SNPs con confirm that excluded SNPs are not excluded due to wrong strand)
step4 - run phaseit with final set of SNPs (excluding those non-matching in step1)

#this processing step is done at 5Mb step for each chromosome
step5 - imputation
step6,7 - get snps for allele-specific read classification and counting, consider only SNPs surely heterozygous SNPs
step8,9 - produce another set of SNPs reformatted to VCF format as needed for TRECASE_MLE option
