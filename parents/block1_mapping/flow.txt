This block needs: 
tophat (or other mapper of choice)
R packages: ShortReads, GenomicAlignments, GenomicFeatures, Rsamtools

overall flow is:


#these processing steps are done for each chromosome
step1 - trim the data
step2 - map
step3 - get short fastqc
step4 - filter out by quality
step5 - get gene level counts
step6 - convert to TRECASE_MLE format
this step is done on 227 selected GEUVADIS samples
#note, for this larger number of samples we choose genes having at least 5 samples with at least 5 allele specific counts
#note, we do see that PC1, PC2 and PC3 reflect whether people are GBR, FIN or TSI so in analysis use actual GBR, FIN and TSI grouping
